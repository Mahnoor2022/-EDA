Key Insights & Observations:

The dataset structure was explored using .info() and .describe(), giving an understanding of data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
Missing Values Handling:

Missing values were identified and handled using imputation or removal techniques.
If many values were missing in a column, they might have been dropped to avoid data bias.
Correlation Analysis:

A heatmap was generated to analyze numerical feature relationships.
Features with strong correlations could be useful for predictive modeling, while weakly correlated features may contribute less.
Categorical Variable Analysis:

Bar charts and value counts were used to explore distributions.
Certain categorical features, like Pclass and Sex in Titanic data, likely showed strong associations with survival rates.
Numerical Feature Distributions:

Histograms were plotted to analyze numerical variable distributions.
Outliers, skewness, or any significant patterns in age, fare, or other numeric features would have been identified.
